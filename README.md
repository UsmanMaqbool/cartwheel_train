# Ideas

* MobileNet / DCF training -> Recall
* Reduce dimension~500 dimention
* Motivation ~ 10,000 photoes and Tags done, 


[test_loadjsonmodel.py](test_loadjsonmodel.py) for using the json model to create the same trained network.

## NetVLAD Training

`tensorboard --logdir='./models.keras/'` to start the tensorboard

A sleek, easy to read/modify implementation of NetVLAD. This needs Keras2.
I have made this with Tensorflow1.11 as the backend but in principle should
also work with other backends supported by keras.

## Author
Manohar Kuse <mpkuse@connect.ust.hk> <br/>


## Required Packages
[Keras2](https://keras.io) - Deep learning. 
TensorFlow - Deep learning toolkit (v.1.08+)<br/>
cv2 - OpenCV <br/>
numpy - Python Math <br/>
[imgaug](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug) - Data Augmentation.
Panda3D - Rendering (only if you use PandaRender.py/PandaRender)<br/>

```
apt-get update && apt-get install python-pip python-opencv graphviz
git clone https://github.com/UsmanMaqbool/cartwheel_train.git 
# pip install keras imgaug
pip install --upgrade pip===9.0.3
pip install keras tensorflow-gpu np_utils six numpy scipy Pillow matplotlib scikit-image imageio Shapely imgaug python-editor pydot panda3d
```


## Howto train?
The main code lies in `noveou_train_netvlad_v3.py`. It mainly depends on `CustomNets.py` (contains network definations, NetVLADLayer, data loading, data augmenters) and on `CustomLosses.py` (contains loss functions
    and validation metrics).

You may want to tune all other parameters such as
the K for NetVLAD, logging directory, SGD optimizer etc. directly from the script `noveou_train_netvlad_v3.py`
Contributions welcome to make this more user friendly.

```
python noveou_train_netvlad_v3.py
```

## Training Data
Make sure you have the Tokyo_TM, PittsburgData and correctly
set the paths. These two datasets can be obtained from
[here](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/netvlad/).
This data is loaded on a per-batch basis. The relavant code is in `test_render.py`
and `CustomNets.py/dataload_()`.

It is also possible to use your own custom data for training, so long as you can
pick positive and negative samples for a query image from your dataset. Here, by positive sample
we refer to an image which is the sample physical place as the query image
but different viewpoints. By negative sample we mean an image with different
physical scene than the query image.

Google's streetview data and Mappillary data are excellent sources for training an even
general representation. Google provides a RestAPI to programatically retrive streetview image
given GPS co-ordinates. I have some scripts to load such data which I plan to release soon.
See [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro) for Streetview-api.
Similarly look at [Mappilary developer API](https://www.mapillary.com/developer) to retrieve mappilary data.

Additionally, data from SLAM system can be yet another good source of training data
for place recognition system.

It is also possible to train this network with a 3D model using Panda3d rendering engine.
See the script `test_render.py`. You need a working panda3d to work. In the
future I will make it easy to train with 3d models (in OBJ format).

If you need help setting up my code with your data, I am willing to help. Put up
info under issues on this github repo, I will try and help you out.
